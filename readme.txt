Adds a Status Update Custom Post Type

== Description ==

This plugin creates a new custom post type of Status Update

By default a status update does not have a title.  You can post a status update
with embedded images and html markup if you wish.  The excerpt should not have
any html in it and by default the plugin will attempt to create a plain text
version of your status update.

For example, if your body contains the html:
  `<p>Wow I really love using <a href="http://shll.me/statustype">Status Update Custom Post Type</a>!</p>`
    
It will automatically generate an excerpt of:
  `Wow I really love using Status Update Custom Post Type - http://shll.me/statustype`
    
It will also try to pull the alt or title attributes out of images so:
  `<img src="http://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example Image" />`
    
Should turn into:
  `Example Image - http://example.com/image.jpg`
    
By default your status updates do not have title, do not generate titles and
I remove the title tag from the RSS feeds.  This may mean your feeds won't
look correct in Google Reader but this is intentional.  For more information
consult the following post:

If it's really important for you that your status updates have titles you
can go under the Settings > Writing page and check "Enable Title" although I
personally recommend against it.

This plugin also makes sure your status updates show up on the homepage and in
your main RSS feed.  I don't know if the way I'm doing it will cause problems
so please contact me if it interferes with anything your doing.  I'm not finding
a lot of documentation about this.  So for now it's trial and error.
